aboutString=LWUIT Demo shows the main features for developing a User Interface (UI) in LWUIT. This demo contains inside additional different sub-demos to demonstrate key features, where each one can be reached from the main screen. For more details about each sub-demo, please visit the demo help screen. For more details about LWUIT feel free to contact us at lwuit@sun.com.
animationHelp=Animations can be invoked by registering the Animation to the Form. When registered the event loop calls to the Animation animate() method and then calls to repaint(). In This examples we have 2 simple Animations that replace images in a loop.
buttonHelp=This Demo shows Buttons functionalities and demos different Buttons types.
dialogHelp=Dialog boxes are modal in the toolkit thus allowing the calling thread to block even if it is the event dispatch thread. Dialogs can occupy parts of the screen that can be defined by the developer.
fontHelp=The toolkit has support for custom fonts and system/device fonts both are fully interchangable and seamless for the developer.
themeHelp=Demonstrates theme switching, select a theme to see the changes occur in the application. A Theme can modify colors, backgrounds, fonts, transparency, margin and padding.
renderingHelp=Demonstrates renderers allowing us to customize the look of data structures returned from the model. By allowing the model to return any data type we can save the need to type convert which allows for far simpler code. We can also customize the widgets to any degree desired.
transitionHelp=Transitions appear when switching from one form to the next, a transition can be bound to the operation of exiting or entering the screen. There are default transitions in the toolkit and custom transitions are easy to write.
tabHelp=This Demo shows TabbedPane functionalities.
layoutHelp=The toolkit supports 5 different Layouts: FlowLayout, BorderLayout, BoxLayout, GridLayout and GroupLayout. In this Demo we added 5 Components to the Form and we changes the Layout and rearrange the Components. A developer can add his own Layout by extending the Layout class.
scrollHelp=Scrolling is supported in Container, List and Textarea. In This Demo we display a List with many enteries to show a simple use-case for scrolling. LWUIT supports touch screen devices as well, and the scrolling feature has an accelerated motion in touch mode.
tableHelp=The table component allows arranging/editing elements in a table for easy viewing/editing of row/column data.
treeHelp=The tree component represents a hierarchy view, here we show the filesystem of the phone as an example.
HTMLHelp=This demo shows HTMLComponent, a powerful component that can render HTML documents conforming to the XHTML-MP 1.0 standard. Documents can be stored locally or fetched from a remote source via HTTP. THis demo shows rendering of a local file.
